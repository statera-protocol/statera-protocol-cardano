# Halalend Protocol V1.1 Specification


## 1. Overview

Halalend lending protocol mimics all the features of the currently existing lending protocols on
Cardano except the interest paid by borrowers on loan repayment, and the fact that the protocol's
own stable coin is going to use to issue loans. Loans are repaid at zero
interest rate.
It also provides a module for swap which involves the redemption of ST tokens with other Cardano stable tokens in a 1:1 ratio.






# (Transactions Overview)
## Set Protocol Parameters
- This transaction requires an input from the multisig (admin) to make sure it signs the transaction,
- `STP` NFT is minted using the `UnifiedControlValidator` as the minting policy. The NFT is sent together with a UTxO containing the `Protocol Parameters` in it's datum. The UTxO is sent to the `UnifiedControlValidator`






## 2. Architecture

- ### Borrow:

There are 4 contracts in the borrow feature:

- Loan NFT Validator: Validates the protocol parameters, oracle rates, and minting of the loan NFT
- Collateral validator: Locks a collateral utxo that represent the collateral of the borrower.
- Mint Loan Validator: Responsible for minting the stable coin (as loans)
- Protocol Parameter Validator: Returns reference transaction input with the protocol parameters

- ### Repayment:

There are 3 contracts in the repayment feature:

- Loan NFT Validator: Validates the conditions necessary for the repayment of loan and burning of the loan NFT
- Collateral validator: Validates that the loan UTxO has satisfied the terms to be returned back to the loan NFT holder
- Mint Loan Validator: Responsible for burning the stable coin (which is the repaid loan)

- ### Liquidation:

There are 2 contracts in the liquidation feature:

- Collateral validator: Validates the condition necessary for liquidation; checks oracle rate and liquidation ratio
- Protocol Parameter Validator: Returns reference transaction input with the protocol parameters


## 3. Specification

### 3.1 Actors

- Borrower: An entity who wants to borrow a loan
- Repayer: An entity who wants to repay a loan. This is the entity in posession of the loan NFT
